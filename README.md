# 8_DigitRecognitionusing_RANDOMFOREST
Built a handwritten digit recognition system using the Random Forest algorithm to classify digits (0–9). Preprocessed image pixel data, trained an ensemble model, and evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. Demonstrates supervised learning and ensemble techniques for image classification.
